How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Initial user needs are first determined by meeting with the customer/client to discuss the functions they want to see in the final product. Often, these functions will be described in the form of user stories, which aids in understanding the needs by speaking about them in a narrative manner. That allows the team to read a user story and place themselves in the shoes of the user trying to use some facet of the end product.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The majority of my development, at least throughout school, will be solo development. Thus, some agile processes are more difficult or impossible to apply. However, the primary agile principle I would like to incorporate in my development is developing in small iterative cycles that each set out to accomplish a certain set of necessary tasks for the final product. I think that this approach will allow be to write better and more efficient code than the "big bang" programming I currently do. I would also like to further explore test-driven development, even as a solo developer.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To me, the cornerstone of being a good team member in any environment is communication. Clear and prompt communication is absolutely invaluable when working in a team as it allows fellow team members to be made aware of everything from concerns to states of progress and successes. The flipside of this is being a good listener. Communication requires effort on both sides, and actively listening to teammates is key in not wasting their efforts to communicate.
